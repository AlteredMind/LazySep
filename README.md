# LazySep

LazySep born with the intent to solve a bug with CSVs exported from a CyberSec Platform and make them usable in excel for further modifications.
this script add at the begging of each .csv files the "sep=," with this simple mod you can open your CSV-files directly with Excel and no other actions are needed.

# Installation

No installation needed, just a simple PS script.

# Usage

It's possible to manage one or more files present in a folder, all the CSVs will be modified and the new file (or files) will be transferred to the "modified" folder.
If the modified folder does not exist, it will be created

v.0.0.1 - first version, only comma SEP.
